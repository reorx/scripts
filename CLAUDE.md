# Scripts Repository

This repository is a collection of scripts I use for working tricks, productivity, and everyday life. Each script is independent and self-contained - they don't rely on each other.

## Development Guidelines

### Script Independence
- Each script works separately and independently
- Don't relate scripts to each other unless explicitly requested
- Work on each file individually

### Python Scripts
- Use only built-in libraries when possible
- Avoid third-party dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- Create single monolithic scripts that do all the work

### Bash Scripts
- Refer to @~/.claude/bash_cheatsheet.md for coding tricks and style guidelines
- Follow best practices for shell scripting

### Script Creation
- Create only one mono script per task
- Make scripts executable with `chmod +x`
- Preserve file extensions (`.sh`, `.py`, etc.)
- Keep everything self-contained in a single file
