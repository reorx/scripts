description: System operations toolkit for local development and debugging. Use when the user needs to check what's running on a port, see process details for a port, kill a process on a port, find what's using a port, free up a port, or deal with "address already in use" errors. Also use for any system-level task like checking listening ports or managing local processes — even if they just say "what's on port 3000", "something is using port 8080", or "kill whatever is on port 8080".

A collection of tools and best practices for common system operations during local development and debugging.

## Port Management

### Check / kill process on a port

**Script:** `scripts/portcheck.sh`

Use this when a user wants to inspect what's running on a port, get detailed process info, or free up a port.

**How to use:**

```bash
# Check what's on a port (info only, no killing)
bash <skill-path>/scripts/portcheck.sh <port>

# Check and kill
bash <skill-path>/scripts/portcheck.sh -k <port>
bash <skill-path>/scripts/portcheck.sh --kill <port>
```

The script displays a key-value report for each process on the port:
- COMMAND, PID, PPID, USER, STAT, %CPU, %MEM, START — from `ps`
- TYPE, NAME — from `lsof` (connection type and address)
- CWD — the process's working directory

With `-k`/`--kill`, the processes are killed after displaying info.

**Typical scenarios:**
- "What's running on port 3000?" → run without `-k`
- "Port 8080 is taken" / "address already in use" → run without `-k` first to show the user, then with `-k` if they confirm
- "Kill whatever is on port 5173" → run with `-k` directly
