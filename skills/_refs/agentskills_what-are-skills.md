# What are skills?

> Agent Skills are a lightweight, open format for extending AI agent capabilities with specialized knowledge and workflows.

At its core, a skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file. This file includes metadata (`name` and `description`, at minimum) and instructions that tell an agent how to perform a specific task. Skills can also bundle scripts, templates, and reference materials.

```directory  theme={null}
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Required: instructions + metadata
├── scripts/          # Optional: executable code
├── references/       # Optional: documentation
└── assets/           # Optional: templates, resources
```

## How skills work

Skills use **progressive disclosure** to manage context efficiently:

1. **Discovery**: At startup, agents load only the name and description of each available skill, just enough to know when it might be relevant.

2. **Activation**: When a task matches a skill's description, the agent reads the full `SKILL.md` instructions into context.

3. **Execution**: The agent follows the instructions, optionally loading referenced files or executing bundled code as needed.

This approach keeps agents fast while giving them access to more context on demand.

## The SKILL.md file

Every skill starts with a `SKILL.md` file containing YAML frontmatter and Markdown instructions:

```mdx  theme={null}
---
name: pdf-processing
description: Extract text and tables from PDF files, fill forms, merge documents.
---

# PDF Processing

## When to use this skill
Use this skill when the user needs to work with PDF files...

## How to extract text
1. Use pdfplumber for text extraction...

## How to fill forms
...
```

The following frontmatter is required at the top of `SKILL.md`:

* `name`: A short identifier
* `description`: When to use this skill

The Markdown body contains the actual instructions and has no specific restrictions on structure or content.

This simple format has some key advantages:

* **Self-documenting**: A skill author or user can read a `SKILL.md` and understand what it does, making skills easy to audit and improve.

* **Extensible**: Skills can range in complexity from just text instructions to executable code, assets, and templates.

* **Portable**: Skills are just files, so they're easy to edit, version, and share.
